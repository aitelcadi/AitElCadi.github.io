My name is Abdessamad AIT EL CADI. I hold a B. Eng. from Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées (ENPC), an M.Sc.A., and a Ph.D. from École Polytechnique de Montréal. Currently I am a Professor at INSA Hauts-de-France and am affiliated with the la boratory [LAMIH UMR CNRS 8201](https://www.uphf.fr/lamih).

My research interests are broad and include optimization (metaheuristics, combinatorial optimization, exact methods), simulation, AI, data mining, statistical analysis, applied to operations management in logistics and supply chain. My work also focused on the integration and coupling of simulation, optimization, and AI to aid decision-making processes. I have, also, a role as the scientific responsible of the Chair [TEC-LOG<sup>d</sup>](https://www.uphf.fr/actualites/lancement-chaire-tec-logd), which addresses issues related to technology, logistics, and sustainable circular economy. This position highlights my commitment to advancing research and development in areas critical to modern industry and society.
